# Pyramid of Pain - TryHackMe

## Overview

This lab focuses on understanding the Pyramid of Pain model and how different indicators impact adversaries during detection and incident response.

The Pyramid of Pain demonstrates that some indicators are easier for attackers to change (such as hashes and IP addresses), while others like TTPs are significantly harder to modify.

Understanding this concept allows security analysts to build more effective detection strategies.
